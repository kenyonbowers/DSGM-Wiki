						<p class="Text">After the original forums went down, there were a few attempts to revive the DS Game maker community. We will go over some of those attempts. However, not every attempt is on here due to not even knowing they happened.</p>
                        <p class="Text">One attempt was back in June of 2016 (June 16th, 2016, to be exact). A person by the name of <a class="SandySage">SandySage</a> uploaded a video showing how to install DS Game Maker. This video by itself did not revive the community. The next attempt to bring the community back was about a years later in 2017. Both <a class="dsgmBoards">dsgm.boards.net</a> and <a class="DiscordOnline">DSGM Online!</a> were created. These two were interconnected having some of the same members, resources, etc.</p>
                        <p class="Text">This then brings us to the next attempt. In 2020, <a class="JamesGarner">James</a> and <a class="Ruffsta">Ruffsta</a> released a website for DS Game Maker. This website is still around and is known as <a class="FanSite">dsgamemaker.online</a>. A little less than a month later, James released the <a class="VM">DS Game Maker VM</a>. This allowed people to download it and run it through VirtualBox without needing to figure out how to get DS Game Maker/old version of devkitPro. This helped spark the community a bit and the built-in forums were moderately active. After the forums had died - end of 2021 - <a class="KenyonBowers">Kenyon</a> found and picked up the DS Game Maker VM from dsgamemaker.online. Within two weeks he created his first DS game with the software. Knowing the DS Game Maker community needed reviving, he created the <a class="Discord">DS Game Maker Discord server</a>. This server ended up growing tremendously. Only a short time of about a few months, <a class="DigitalDesignDude">DigitalDesignDude</a> created the <a class="DSGMResourceSite">DSGM Resource Site</a>. Once Kenyon realized that the DS Game Maker server was growing at a fast rate, he created the <a class="Subreddit">DS Game Maker Subreddit</a>. A month later, he created a DSGM News Twitter account. This was deleted only a few days later due to him not liking the content that was on Twitter.</p>
