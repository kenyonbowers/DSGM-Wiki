						<p class="Text">Before DS Game Maker, there was a game engine made. It was known as XtenDS. This engine, while not super feature rich, allowed you to create homebrew for the Nintendo DS. The creator of this software is known as <a class="JamesGarner">James Garner</a>. After a few versions of XtenDS were released, James found that he wasn't reaching as many people as YoYo's popular Game Maker was. This led James to rename XtenDS to DS Game Maker. After he renamed it, he released the first version of DS Game Maker. DS Game Maker started to pick up steam. DS Game Maker ended up being a popular choice for getting into NDS homebrew or game dev in general. It is not known when the forums went up. But we speculate it was around the time DS Game Maker v1.0 was released. The forums lasted until mid-2016 when they was taken down. Many pages are still available to view via the <a class="WebArchives">internet archive</a>.</p>
                        <p class="Text">After the forums when down, there was a video uploaded by <a class="SandySage">SandySage</a> showing how to install DS Game Maker now that the forums and site were offline. This is an important piece of the puzzle which we will get back too. After this video was released, <a class="DiscordOnline">DSGM Online!</a>, the first DS Game Maker Discord server, was created. It was created on June 23rd, 2017. <a class="dsgmBoards">dsgm.boards.net</a> was also created around this time. On May 22nd, 2020, James and <a class="Ruffsta">Ruffsta</a> finished work on the <a class="FanSite">dsgamemaker.online</a> site. This site had games, resources, and a forum for DS Game Maker. Around a month later, on June 15th of 2020, the <a class="VM">DS Game Maker Virtual Machine</a> was released by James. This helped spark the community quite a bit. But this didn't last long. Because once it got to 2022, the forums were basically dead.</p>
                        <p class="Text">Remember that video from SandySage? At this time, <a class="DigitalDesignDude">DigitalDesignDude</a> made a video going over how to <a class="InstallOnWin10">install DS Game Maker on Windows 10</a>, which was inspired by SandySage's video. And then, at some point in January, <a class="KenyonBowers">Kenyon Bowers</a> found the Virtual Machine and used it to create his own DS game. When he saw that this software needed a bigger and better community, he created the <a class="Discord">DS Game Maker Discord server</a>. This server was created on February 17th, 2022. This server steadily grew over the next few months. In June of 2022, DigitalDesignDude released a <a class="DSGMInstallonWin10/11">written installation tutorial for DS Game Maker</a>. On July 25th, 2022, DigitalDesignDude released the <a class="DSGMResourceSite">DS Game Maker Resource Site</a>. Later, he also released both DS Game Maker versions <a class="v5.21A">v5.21A</a> and <a class="v5.21B">v5.21B</a>. When Kenyon saw how big the community was starting to get, he decided to make the <a class="Subreddit">DS Game Maker Subreddit</a>. About a month later, Kenyon created a Twitter account for DS Game Maker. This account was deleted on November 1st, 2022, due to him not liking what he was seeing on Twitter.</p>
